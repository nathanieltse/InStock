# What is it?
INSTOCK is a full-stack warehouse inventory tracking system web application, that allows for updating of on-hand inventory status within a list of warehouses.
It utilizes React for the client side and Node.js for the service side. This is a collaboration project involving a few developers with a limited time constraint.
